# Knight-s-tour-problem
Both the programs use the same technique to solve the Knight's tour problem.The code makes use of heuristics instead of blind
brute force to find a solution. The * on the printed board indicate that the knight visited that square once during the 
tour. If the number of moves is 64, it means that the program has successfully solved the problem as the total number of 
squares on a chess board is 64.
